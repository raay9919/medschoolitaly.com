            <div class="information"> <h1> ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h1><p>This website is intented for the students who have terminated their education in Burma due to certain reasons and for those
                who would like to study medicine and other programs abroad with very little tuition fees. 
                Italy might be one of the best country for study medicine due to its dramatically low tuition fees and 
                the admission exams being provided that can be taken by anyone. Not only the tuition fees are negligible, but also the Universities
                provided both merit-based and financial-based scholarships for numerous students. Moreover, the medical school admission exam is relatively
                easy if you have studied medicine previously. But first, you need to know lots of things before you prepare to come to Italy and actually
                come to Italy. The topics are discussed on individual pages.</p>

            <div class="about"> <h1>IS THE INFORMATION ON THIS WEBSITE RELIABLE?</h1>
                <p>I am a student currently living in Italy and studying medicine at the International Medical School in Milan. 
                I arrived in Italy in September 2022 and joined 
                foundation year program at the University of Pavia. After I had finished foundation year program, I took the International Medical
                Admission Test (IMAT) in October 2023 and got admitted to the the medicine program at the University of Milan. On this website 
                I have written all the informations that I know about the processes, requirements and informations about studying in Italy based on my 
                experience. </p>
